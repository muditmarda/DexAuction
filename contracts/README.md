# DexAuction Contracts

Tezos smart contracts written in SmartPy (a Python Library), compiled down to Michelson (a stack-based assembly like language) and designed in a mediator proxy and factory design patterns have been used to create and manage auctions. An Auction contract acting as a proxy contract (containing master data and functionalities) is created along with factory contracts for the various auctioning models like English, Dutch, Sealed Bid, and Vickrey. This Master/Proxy Auction contract receives auctioning requests from users desiring to sell their assets through an auctioning process, registering the asset if not already registered, initiates the auction, and instantiates a customisable auctioning contract instance from the respective factory. Based on the requirements of the auctioneer/seller, the parameters of the auctioning contract instance are configured by the seller/auctioneer. The Auction contract represents each asset with a unique asset_id as different transferable non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
Once the auction is over, the auctioned assets and the final settlement amount held by the auction instance contract will eventually be released to the respective parties in an atomic swap.
